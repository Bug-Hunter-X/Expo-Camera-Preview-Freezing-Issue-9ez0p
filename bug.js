This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom `Camera` component.  The camera preview might freeze or fail to render correctly after a certain period, especially under heavy load or after several re-renders of the component.  The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging difficult.  The camera continues to function (capturing images still works), but the preview is broken.
